# Restaurant Application

API for a restaurant application. Created for study purposes.

## How to Execute
- Run `docker-compose up`
- Open localhost:2000/docs on your browser

## Backlog (TODO)
- Validate input parameters on controllers
- Improve error handling: return different status code for different error reasons
- Improve file structure: have adapter and core folders under different domains
